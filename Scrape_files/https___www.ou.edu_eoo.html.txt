Institutional Equity Office
The Board of Regents created the Institutional Equity Office on January 24, 2012, to promote and foster the University's commitment to creating and maintaining a community where all persons who participate in University programs and activities can work and learn together in an atmosphere free from discrimination and harassment. The Institutional Equity Office reports to the President and Board of Regents
and handles discrimination claims, affirmative action plans, claims involving the Sexual Misconduct, Discrimination and Harassment Policy, and gender equity issues related to athletics.
