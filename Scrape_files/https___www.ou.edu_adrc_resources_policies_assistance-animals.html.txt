Types of Assistance Animals
Service Animals
A service animal is either a dog or miniature pony that has been trained to complete a specific task. Only two questions may be asked of individuals with service animals:
Is there a disability?
Is the animal trained to complete a specific task/duty?
Legally, individuals with service animals are
not
required to register their animal. They are not required to wear a vest or be leashed.
Handlers must retain good control over the animal, and the animal must be well-behaved. If a service animal in your class becomes disruptive or aggressive and the handler is unable to regain or maintain control, report them to the ADRC.
For questions or concerns regarding service animals, please contact us.
Emotional Support Animals (ESA)
ESAs are not trained to perform a specific task and come in a wide variety of animals (dog, cat, lizard, rabbit, snake, etc.). They are allowed on OU campus only in areas in which pets are generally allowed after approval from the ADRC. Some may wear vests or have identification cards, but if the answer to either of the questions above is “no,” the animal is not a service animal and therefore not allowed in class.
