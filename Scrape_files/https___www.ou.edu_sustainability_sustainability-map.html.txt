Campus Sustainability Map
As an institution of higher education, it is the University of Oklahoma's role and responsibility to develop solutions for a more sustainable future. Through education, innovation, and tangible actions, the university seeks to promote awareness and progress toward sustainability.  The
Sustainability Map
achieves this through the digitalization of many of the sustainability initiatives taking place at the OU-Norman Campus.  Visit the map to learn more about the University's transportation, energy, building, recycling, food, landscape and academic efforts.
The
Sustainability Map
is hosted on the ArcGIS platform.
