Campus Life
SO MUCH TO DO.
AND SO MANY TO DO IT WITH.
Once you’re here, you’ll quickly understand why there’s only one Oklahoma.
While the Sooner way of life exemplifies a determination that drives us toward varied purposes, this tenacity is tempered by humility and compassion.
You’ll find kindred souls as you explore over 400 organizations, attend inspiring campus events, and experience our remarkable athletic programs. Situated in the close-knit community of Norman, OK, we’re also just 20 minutes away from the energetic bustle of Oklahoma City.
