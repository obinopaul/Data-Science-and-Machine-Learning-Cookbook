PREVIOUS YEARS
Norman Campus has historically been comprised of several organizational parts: Norman On-Campus program, Norman-based programs offered at the Tulsa campus, and non-traditional programs administered by the Extended Campus (formerly known as College of Continuing Education).
Prior to 2015, IRR provided enrollment data for Norman On-Campus only by default. Changes in location-based offerings, increase of non-traditional student populations, and the advancement of educational technology made that practice unrepresentative of overall campus activities. An overall Norman Campus reporting approach better reflects the interconnected nature of the campus's activities.
We realize that providing enrollment for all Norman Campus programs does not work for all purposes. If you are interested in the number of students living in and around Norman and attending classes in-person, using Norman On-Campus only data may be most useful. Please contact us if you need data summarized in a different manner than is presented here.
For prior years not listed, please contact our office.
