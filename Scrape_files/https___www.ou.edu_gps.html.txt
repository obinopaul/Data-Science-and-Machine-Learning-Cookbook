Welcome to Graduation and Persistence Support
Graduation and Persistence Support (GPS)
is committed to seeing students achieve their goal of graduating from the University of Oklahoma. The GPS team works collaboratively with other support resources across campus to promote student success. We can personally assist students in removing any potential roadblocks to continuous enrollment and clear pathways to degree completion.
We know each student will have a unique set of experiences throughout their academic journey. GPS is here to help students navigate college successfully.
If you or someone you know could use some additional support or direction, complete the Compass Network Student Referral below.
