Classroom
The Accessibility and Disability Resource Center will coordinate sign language interpreters and real time captioning services on campus. We strive to provide the highest quality accommodations by hiring qualified sign language interpreters and captionists. Students are encouraged to pre-enroll to ensure the availability of interpreters and real time captionists. It is important to provide schedule information to the ADRC as soon as possible and to communicate with ADRC staff about class schedules at pre-enrollment.
